Below is a **detailed, step-by-step plan** for implementing **Milestone 2: “Graph Evolution Lab”**, taking into account both the **00_vision_and_high_level_plan** and the **03_M2_decisions** documents, as well as your additional suggestions.

---

## 1. **Repository & Project Setup**

1. **New Git Repository**  
   - **Create a dedicated repo** (e.g., `guca-evolution-lab`) separate from the GUCA web demo.
   - Use a conventional layout:
     ```
     guca-evolution-lab/
       ├─ src/
       ├─ tests/
       ├─ docs/
       ├─ examples/
       ├─ configs/
       └─ README.md
     ```
   - Include a basic **README** describing the project’s purpose and referencing the original GUCA web repo.

2. **Configuration & Experiment Management**  
   - Incorporate **Hydra-Core** (per M2 decisions) or a similar flexible config approach.  
     - Provide config files (YAML) that define **GA parameters**, **experiment settings**, **logging** options, etc.
     - Example config: `configs/default.yaml` for standard defaults, plus optional `configs/experiment_x.yaml` for specialized runs.

3. **Experiment Tracking**  
   - Integrate a minimal **ClearML** or **Weights & Biases** (alternative) setup for logging experiment metadata (population stats, fitness progression, etc.).  
   - Keep it optional or behind a flag so users can run locally without an account.

---

## 2. **Implement the Python GUM Machine (Graph Unfolding Automaton)**

1. **Basic Data Structures**  
   - **Node Class** (e.g., `GUMNode`):  
     - Fields for `state`, `priorState`, connection counts, etc.  
     - Methods for state transitions, marking as new or deleted.
   - **Edge Representation**: Either an adjacency list or your chosen graph library (networkx, custom adjacency, etc.).
   - **Graph Class** (`GUMGraph`):  
     - Methods to add/remove nodes, track edges, check connectivity, etc.  
     - Methods for “try to connect,” “give birth,” “die,” etc.

2. **Change Table** (Genome Representation)  
   - A list (or other structure) of rules: `(Condition → Operation)`.  
   - Each `Condition` includes current/prior states, connection constraints, etc.  
   - Each `Operation` includes operation type (`TurnToState`, `GiveBirthConnected`, `DisconnectFrom`, etc.) and an operand (often a new state).

3. **Execution Logic**  
   - **GraphUnfoldingMachine**:  
     - Loads a change table (the “genome”).  
     - **`run_one_step()`**: For each node, pick the first matching rule; apply the operation.  
     - Keep track of number of steps, stop conditions (max steps, no changes, etc.).  
   - **Configurations**:  
     - **Transcription Mode** (`Resettable` vs. `Continuable`): If the machine resets reading from the top of the rule list each iteration or continues where it left off.  
     - **Count Comparisons** (exact vs. range-based).  
     - **Max vertices** or **max connections** to prevent unbounded explosion.

4. **Testing & Validation**  
   - **Unit Tests**: Provide known “genes” (from M1 or older C# code) that produce a predictable outcome.  
     - Example: A single “give birth” rule that always spawns a child node → verify resulting graph’s node count.  
     - Example: A “turn to state B if prior was A” rule → after one iteration, check all A nodes become B.
   - **CI/CD Setup**: If feasible, integrate with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to run tests automatically.

## 3. **Implement a Simple Genetic Algorithm Around GUCA**

1. **Select a GA Framework**  
   - **DEAP** recommended (from the M2 decisions) for flexible, arbitrary-length genomes and parallel evaluation.  
   - Alternatively, you could implement a custom GA “by hand,” but DEAP saves a lot of boilerplate.

2. **Chromosome / Individual Representation**  
   - Each **Chromosome** = a variable-length list of `(Condition, Operation)` rules.  
   - Must handle:
     - **Initialization** (random rules of random length).  
     - **Mutation** (change random fields; insert/delete rules).  
     - **Crossover** (combine subsets of rules from two parents).

3. **Fitness Function**  
   - **Run** the GUM machine for N steps.  
   - Evaluate the resulting graph structure (e.g., number of nodes, planarity checks, or specific distribution metrics).  
   - Possibly penalize large rule tables, or extremely large graphs.  
   - Return a numeric fitness. Higher is better, or invert if the GA library expects minimal cost.

4. **Core GA Loop**  
   - Generate population → evaluate each → select → crossover → mutate → new population → repeat.  
   - Keep track of best solution so far.  
   - Stop after X generations or if fitness threshold is reached.

5. **Parallelization**  
   - Use **DEAP’s `map`-based approach** or standard Python concurrency to evaluate the population in parallel.  
   - If each individual’s graph unfolding is expensive, set the number of processes to match CPU cores.

6. **Integration & Logging**  
   - For each generation, log:
     - Best/mean fitness.  
     - Distribution of chromosome lengths.  
     - Maybe store the best “change table” for checkpointing.

## 4. **Optional: Basic GUI or Visualization**

1. **CLI + Notebook** (Minimal Approach)  
   - For **quick iteration**: rely on textual logs, and occasionally load the “best” solution in a **Jupyter Notebook** to visualize the graph (e.g., with `networkx` or `matplotlib`).  
   - Save intermediate “best graphs” in a standard format (e.g., JSON or `.dot`) to visualize outside the main loop.

2. **Lightweight PyQt / Web Preview** (If Time Permits)  
   - If you’d like real-time updates:
     - Implement a minimal “viewer” that can read the best solution from a file or shared memory and draw it in a window.  
     - Or integrate with a library like **VisPy** for real-time 2D rendering.

3. **Logging Artifacts**  
   - Keep snapshots of the best genome’s graph to disk in each checkpoint. Later, you can open them in the Notebook to compare shapes, measure stats, etc.

---

## 5. **Analytics in Jupyter Notebooks**

1. **Experiment Folder Structure**  
   - E.g., `experiments/exp_2025_02_16/` to store logs, best solutions, CSV of per-generation data.  
   - A notebook can read these artifacts to produce:
     - Fitness-over-time charts.  
     - Graph-level metrics (avg degree distribution, size, connectivity).
     - Rule usage stats (e.g., how often each gene triggered).

2. **Interactive Graph Visualization**  
   - Load saved best-chromosome states.  
   - Use `networkx` + `matplotlib` or `pyvis` (for interactive web-based).  
   - Show side-by-side comparisons of different generations or different runs.

---

## 6. **Extended Features**

1. **Island Model or Parallel GA**  
   - In DEAP, create multiple sub-populations (“islands”), each running its own GA.  
   - Every few generations, **migrate** top individuals among islands.  
   - Scale out to multiple machines if desired (depending on the cluster setup).

2. **Multiple “Sex” or Recombination Operators**  
   - You can explore advanced mating or “gene injection” operators.  
   - Possibly treat gene segments as blocks that can be swapped in multi-point crossovers, or do “rule-based swaps” (swapping entire condition blocks at once).

3. **Optimized Computations**  
   - Use **multiprocessing** or **Ray** or **dask** to scale across multiple CPU cores or nodes.  
   - **Profile** the code to see if graph updates or fitness evaluation can be streamlined (e.g., short-circuit if the graph is “too big” or “too small”).

4. **Documentation & Instructions**  
   - A short **User Guide** in `docs/` describing how to:
     1. Install dependencies (Python 3.10, DEAP, Hydra, etc.).  
     2. Run a basic experiment (via CLI).  
     3. Customize parameters (mutation rates, population size).
     4. Inspect results (Jupyter Notebook or text logs).

5. **Umbrella Repo**  
   - Once the core lab is stable, create a top-level or “umbrella” repository or README linking:
     - GUCA Web Demo Repo  
     - GUCA Evolution Lab Repo  
     - Additional docs about the entire GUCA ecosystem.

## 7. **Suggested Order of Development**

1. **Set up the repository and environment**  
2. **Implement & test GUM Machine** (core classes + unit tests)  
3. **Write a minimal GA** (or connect DEAP) and test with trivial fitness function (“maximize number of nodes,” etc.)  
4. **Add advanced fitness logic** (e.g., planarity, shape constraints) + experiments  
5. **Add parallel/multiprocessing** for performance  
6. **Implement optional GUI / or rely on Jupyter** for partial visualization  
7. **Add island model** for advanced evolution  
8. **Refine performance** (profiling, optimization)  
9. **Write documentation & instructions**  
10. **Create or update an umbrella README** or GitHub Pages site linking everything together

## 8. **Deliverables for M2**

- **Python Implementation** of GUM (nodes, edges, rules, run loop).  
- **Simple GA** integrated with the GUM machine, producing an evolving population of change tables.  
- **CLI-based experiment runner** (with config files).  
- **Logging** (population stats, best solutions).  
- **Unit tests** ensuring GUM behaves as expected (especially for known test rules).  
- **Optional**: Basic real-time or offline GUI for best solutions.  
- **Documentation** detailing:
  - How to run an experiment  
  - GA + GUCA parameters  
  - Where to find results (and how to visualize them in Jupyter)

### Wrap-Up

Following the above plan will give you a **robust, extensible “Graph Evolution Lab”** in Python, enabling you to **run, observe, and iterate** on evolutionary experiments with GUCA. You can start small (CLI + unit tests) and expand gradually (GUI, parallel islands) as needed. Good luck, and feel free to adjust any portion to match your preferred tooling or timelines!
